First, you should know what WT (Wavelet Transform) is used for.

And WT has many versions, such as CWT, DWT, etc.

I think you knew about FT (Fourier Transform) before you knew about WT (Wavelet Transform).

Actually, this material is designed for people as young as 9th grade (~14 years old) to learn from. Because the author is also around 14 years old.
