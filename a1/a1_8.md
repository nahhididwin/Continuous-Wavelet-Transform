# Amplitude and Phase:

**1. Amplitude (Magnitude)**

The amplitude tells you how much of a certain frequency is present at a specific moment in time.
It measures the "strength" or "energy" of the signal. If you plot the amplitude across all times and scales, you get a Scalogram.
In a scalogram, bright colors usually represent high amplitude, meaning the signal has a strong component at that specific frequency and time.

Note : x is the coordinate on the horizontal axis, y is the coordinate on the y-axis;


Amplitude = |W(a,b)| = √(x^2 + y^2)


**2. Phase**

The phase tells you the exact timing or "state" of the oscillation within that frequency band.
While amplitude tells you the "volume" of a frequency, phase tells you where in its cycle (peak, trough, or zero-crossing) the wave is.

Phase = ϕ = arctan(y/x)
