We have:

Let "i" be the imaginary number.

i^2 = -1

i = √(-1)

Imagine if a number 'a' were multiplied by i^2, it would be a "180-degree turn".

Imagine if a number 'a' were multiplied by 'i', it would be "rotating 90 degrees".

Typically, we only have "180-degree turns," which means positive and negative numbers.

You can imagine it as "1D," or having only one x-axis.

But thanks to "i", we've opened up another axis, the y-axis.
